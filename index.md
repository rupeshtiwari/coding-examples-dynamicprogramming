# Dynamic Programming Learning

Dynamic programming (DP) is about finding some work that is repeating multiple time un-necessary. So you save the result of that sub-problem and reuse multiple times to avoid extra computation.

## Types of Dynamic Programming

Normally, 3 types of problems can be solved by DP.

### 1- Count something, often the number of ways

Examples:

- Number of ways to re-arrange elements in a sequence that satisfies some condition.
- Number of paths from one vertex to other.

### 2- Minimize or Maximize certain value.

### 3- YES/NO questions.

Given a set of numbers check if there is sub-set with the sum of elements equal to the given target value.

2nd and 3rd types problems can be solved by Greedy approach also. Therefore, DP can be greedy like `Kaden's algorithm`.

## Iterative vs Recursion for DP

| Iteration                                                                                                                | Recursion                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Speed                                                                                                                    | Easy to apply                 |
| Shorter code                                                                                                             | Fewer States                  |
| **Easier complexity**: Easy to get time and space complexity of program                                                  | Order of state doesn't matter |
| **Harder techniques**: In hard problems, iteration allows us the harder techniques like `Prefix-Sum` and `Segment Trees` |                               |

## In DP should I use recursive or iterative approach?

Because iterative approach allow us to apply harder techniques and gives less time complexity ever. I would recommend using iterative approach while solving problems using DP.

## When I need Dynamic Programming?

Whenever you find repetitive computation in your sub-problems then apply DP.

Examples:

- **Calculate Fibonacci**: We end up computing duplicate numbers. So we should apply DP and optimize our solution.

- **Calculate Factorial**: We do not repeat any calculation. Therefore, DP is not applied here.

## How to approach Dynamic Programming?

In DP you need to define the **state** and the **state transition** of the result at any given position/time.

There are 3 varieties of states in DP described as below:

- If question is asking the **number of way**s person arrive to the given position. Then in DP you store number to indicate the ways/choices at given positions. `DP[i] = number`
- If question is asking can person arrive or **is it possible** (YES/NO) to arrive to the given position. Then in DP you store Boolean value to indicate yes or no at given position. `DP[i] = true|false`
- If question is asking to maximize the possibility to the given position. Then in DP you store maximum value at any position. `DP[i] = maximumValue at position i.`

## Tips to remember while approaching DP

At any position think ðŸ¤” what is important so far.

- Is the number of jumps
- May be last jump is important because you are forbidden to make 2 consecutive jumps.

## Dynamic Programming Problems

### Example of DP: You are climbing a staircase. It takes N steps to reach to the top. How many distinct ways a person can arrive to the top? Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps

In this example the state is number and the transition is `dp[i]=dp[i-1]+dp[i-2]`. This is same as Fibonacci series question.

### Problem of DP: You are climbing a staircase. It takes N steps to reach to the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. How many distinct ways a person can arrive to the the top at most `k` jumps?

**What is the state?**

State is described as position and the number of jumps required to arrive that position.

`state = dp[i][k];`

**What is the state transition?**

![](https://i.imgur.com/ajBg7h2.png)

Answer will be the sum over DP of n and the j the number of jumps over j from `0` up to `k`. Because you are allowed to make at most k jumps.

**What is Space Complexity?**

`O(N*K)`

**What is time complexity?**

`O(1)` constant time.

### Given a grid, find a path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner that minimizes the sum of numbers along the path. You can only move right or down.

In this question Greedy approach will not work. So We have to go by DP.

### Given the target value N and an array of allowed numbers, count ways to write N as the sum of those numbers.
