# Dynamic Programming Learning

Dynamic programming (DP) is about finding some work that is repeating multiple time un-necessary. So you save the result of that sub-problem and re-use multiple times to avoid extra computation. 

## Types of Dynamic Programming

1- Count something, often the number of ways. 





Iterative approach in dynamic programming is recommended. Don't use recursive approach.

| Iteration | Recursion    |
| --------- | ------------ |
| Speed     | Easy to code |
| Speed     | Easy to code |
