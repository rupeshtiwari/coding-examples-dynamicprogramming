# Dynamic Programming Learning

Dynamic programming (DP) is about finding some work that is repeating multiple time un-necessary. So you save the result of that sub-problem and re-use multiple times to avoid extra computation.

## Types of Dynamic Programming

Normally, 3 types of problems can be solved by DP.

### 1- Count something, often the number of ways

Examples:

- Number of ways to re-arrange elements in a sequence that satisfies some condition.
- Number of paths from one vertex to other.

### 2- Minimize or Maximize certain value.

### 3- YES/NO questions.

Given a set of numbers check if there is sub-set with the sum of elements equal to the given target value.

2nd and 3rd types problems can be solved by Greedy approach also. Therefore, DP can be greedy like `Kaden's algorithm`.

## Iterative vs Recursion for DP


| Iteration                                                                                                                | Recursion                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Speed                                                                                                                    | Easy to apply                 |
| Shorter code                                                                                                             | Fewer States                  |
| **Easier complexity**: Easy to get time and space complexity of program                                                  | Order of state doesn't matter |
| **Harder techniques**: In hard problems, iteration allows us the harder techniques like `Prefix-Sum` and `Segment Trees` |                               |

## In DP should I use recursive or iterative approach?
